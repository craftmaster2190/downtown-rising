    I'm envisioning it broken out by day such as Thursday and then sub-headers with each venue and inside of the venue
    would sit the lineup. It would also be amazing to have the ability to search by artist and then see exactly when
    they play. I also feel like we should link to each artist's personal website or a page on the City Weekly site for
    each band.
